For the STATS 750 class at American University, I was  tasked with utilizing a dataset from the Arab Barometer Wave VI, conducted between July 2020 and April 2021. The dataset comprises three segments of the survey: Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3.

As part of the assignment requirements, I was expected to demonstrate my data wrangling skills by producing a codebook. The dataset originates from the Arab Barometer, which conducts national surveys across the Middle East.

To fulfill the assignment, the following steps were required:

Download the Wave VI data from the Arab Barometer download zone
Limit the sample to surveys conducted in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia.
Clean the dataset to extract the following variables:
c_name: country name
source: "Arab Barometer"
r_id: respondent ID
r_year: year of interview
r_month: month of interview
r_swt: survey weight
r_female: binary indicator for female
p_ideology: left-right ideological self-placement
p_interest: interest in politics
p_economy: evaluation of the national economy over the past year
4 measures of satisfaction with and/or preference for democracy

The final deliverable is a cleaned dataset containing these specified variables and a deliverable codebook.
